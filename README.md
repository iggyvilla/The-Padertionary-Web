This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is just a little React project that holds me and my friends' inside jokes. It's live at https://thepadertionary.web.app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
